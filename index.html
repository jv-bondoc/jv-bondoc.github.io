		<h2>Name: Jerome V. Bondoc</h2>
		<h2>Nickname: Jerome</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Favorite CMSC subject so far: CMSC 130</h3>
		<p>I like CMSC 130 so far because it introduces me to how computer hardware works.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Favorite GE so far: Ethics</h3>
		<p>I like Ethics so far because it's the subject that allows one to think his/her own way while relating to subject matters.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Favorite PL: Python</h3>
		<p>I like Python because of its flexibility, since you can use it for object-oriented or structured programming and the syntax doesn't include semi-colons, which keeps annoying me to no end.<br></p>
		<br>
		<h3>Favorite Food: Pizza (without pineapples)</h3>
